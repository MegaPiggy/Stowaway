		PHLOX: Projection walls allow Nomai to talk to each other without being in the same place. It's a wonderful technology for talking to friends from far away!

		<Text>
		PHLOX: To use a projection wall, a projection stone needs to be put in the pedestal. This connects the projection wall to the corresponding projection wall, sharing anything written on both walls!

		PHLOX: Incoming messages from the other projection wall are written in an orange color! This makes it easier to tell which side is talking.

		FILIX: It's true! Though they are unable to connect to the Vessels' communication network, the projection walls were an iteration of their design, which separated incoming and outgoing messages into different walls.
