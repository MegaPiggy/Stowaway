		CLARY: I am fine, Poke. But why did you so urgently call for me? I was so eager to finally jump into the black hole we have lived above for so long!

		POKE: Clary, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>White Hole Station</color>]]> is not yet operational! Had you jumped into the black hole, you would have been stranded!

		<Text>
		POKE: A warp transmitter requires a connected warp receiver to function; the <![CDATA[<color=orange>White Hole Station's</color>]]> warp transmitter does not yet have a connected warp receiver for it to transport Nomai to at this time!
		</Text>

		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
		CLARY: What? Poke, I do not understand why you would leave this step for last! Has a site for the <![CDATA[<color=orange>White Hole Station's</color>]]> warp receiver been chosen yet?
		</Text>

		<Text>
		POKE: There should be ample space on the surface above the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hanging City.</color>]]> Building the warp receiver there should also provide convenient travel back to the city from the <![CDATA[<color=orange>White Hole Station.</color>]]>
		</Text>

		CLARY: That sounds wise. In that case, I'm off to install the warp receiver on the surface!
