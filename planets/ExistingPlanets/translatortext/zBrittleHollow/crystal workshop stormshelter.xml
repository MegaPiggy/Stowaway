		THATCH: Kousa, we thank you deeply for your incredible invention. The storm shelters have done a wonderful job protecting us from the cyclones on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Giant's Deep</color>]]> thus far!

		THATCH: However, I was curious about the issue we reported regarding this new invention some time ago.. Have you been able to investigate this issue as of yet?

		KOUSA: Ah, Thatch, did I not explain this to you when you last visited? The storm shelters are not powered by cyclones.. They are powered by solar panels!

		KOUSA: When an island is sent into orbit, the solar panels installed on the island are able to receive sunlight unimpeded by the planet's thick clouds.. This is what allows the storm shelters to autonomously activate.

		KOUSA: However, if a storm shelter powered down immediately upon reentry into the planet, they would rest too prematurely, and do little to protect a Nomai against the planet's intense gravity.

		<Text>
		KOUSA: That is why these solar panels are tuned to detect the faintest sunlight, allowing them to power the storm shelter slightly before and after a cyclone encounter, keeping its guests safely protected.

		<ParentID>7</ParentID>
		<Text>
		KOUSA: As the sun passes directly over an island, more sunlight is able to penetrate the clouds and reach the solar panel. This is the most likely cause of the issue the Nomai on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Giant's Deep</color>]]> have encountered.
