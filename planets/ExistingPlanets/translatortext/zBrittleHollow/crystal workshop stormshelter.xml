		THATCH: However, Cassava and I recently noticed the storm shelters sometimes activate on their own, even in the absence of any cyclones. Is this quirk an intended function of the storm shelter?

		KOUSA: Young Thatch, did I not explain to you how the storm shelters function when you last visited? The storm shelters are not powered by cyclones, but solar panels!

		KOUSA: As an island is sent into orbit, the solar panels installed on the island detect sunlight unimpeded by the planet's thick clouds. This is what powers on the storm shelters to protect any Nomai within them.

		KOUSA: However, if a storm shelter powered down immediately upon reentry into the planet's thick clouds, they would rest too prematurely, and do little to protect a Nomai against the planet's intense gravity..

		<Text>
		KOUSA: That is why the solar panels are tuned to detect the faintest sunlight, allowing them to power the storm shelter slightly before and after a cyclone encounter, keeping guests safely protected throughout the event.

		<Text>
		KOUSA: However, as a result of this sensitivity, as the sun passes directly over an island, more sunlight is able to penetrate the clouds and reach the solar panel. This is most likely what causes the storm shelters' erroneous activation.
