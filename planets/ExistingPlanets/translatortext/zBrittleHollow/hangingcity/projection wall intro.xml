		ILEX: Projection walls allow Nomai to talk to each other without being in the same place. It's a wonderful technology for talking to friends that are far away!

		ILEX: To use a projection wall, a projection stone must first be placed into its pedestal. This allows the projection wall to connect to the projection wall corresponding to the projection stone.
