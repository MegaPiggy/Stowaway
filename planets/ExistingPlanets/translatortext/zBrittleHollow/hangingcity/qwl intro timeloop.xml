		SPIRE: Friends at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hanging City:</color>]]> I recently crafted a model of <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Hollow's Lantern</color>]]> at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Crossroads,</color>]]> which I hoped would allow us to forecast where meteors land on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow.</color>]]>

		SPIRE: After Phlox noticed inaccuracies in the model's predictions, we decided to study meteor impacts during a negative time interval, hoping to improve the model's data.

		PRIVET: However, during this study, we noticed meteors which strayed from the paths they previously took in the negative time interval.

		PRIVET: This issue has confounded us greatly.. If anyone knows at all why this discrepancy in the negative time interval occurred, we implore you to share your thoughts here!

		PRIVET: How odd, Spire.. How could there be discrepancies in natural events that occur during a negative time interval?

		CONOY: This is a perplexing issue indeed. Perhaps we should build a structure in stationary orbit around <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Hollow's Lantern</color>]]> to study this discrepancy more thoroughly.

		CONOY: I fear the possibility that it might be an issue not with Spire's model, but with the mechanisms behind the negative time interval...

		PRIVET: I agree with Conoy; we must study the source of this discrepancy at once. Otherwise, it could interfere with the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ash Twin Project!</color>]]>
