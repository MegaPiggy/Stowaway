		FILIX: Could you be recalling the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Quantum Moon Locator</color>]]> built on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin's</color>]]> south pole, Bells? We saw that during our first journey to <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin!</color>]]>

		BELLS: I have heard that unlike the locator here on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow,</color>]]> their <![CDATA[<color=orange>Quantum Moon Locator</color>]]> is able to track the precise position of the wandering moon.

		BELLS: We were so overwhelmed in the joy of our reunion, I did not think to inquire how their device worked! I hope to study it to improve the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sixth Location Locator</color>]]> here on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Brittle Hollow</color>]]> too.
