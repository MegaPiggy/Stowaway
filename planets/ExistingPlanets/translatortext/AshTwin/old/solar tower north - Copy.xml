		CLARY: Yarrow, is this the solar tower you have been constructing? It is.. a little smaller than I imagined!
		YARROW: Yes, this is the central shaft of the solar tower, Clary.
		YARROW: Have my faith it is quite colossal in size.. it is simply buried by sand right now! I am patiently awaiting the sand on Ash Twin to flow back to Ember Twin soon to resume its construction.
		CLARY: You have my sympathy and respect for your patience, Yarrow.. It must be quite frustrating working on a planet with such unpredictable phenomena!
		YARROW: Unpredictable? No no, the Hourglass Twins' sandflow is quite predictable, Clary!
		YARROW: Have you heard of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hourglass Observatory,</color>]]> Clary? It is a station in a stationary orbit behind the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins.</color>]]>
		YARROW: If you accompany me there, I could show you how to tell when the sand transfer occurs!
		CLARY:  I'd be thrilled if you would, Yarrow! There is some work I need to tend to first - but where should I meet you once I am ready? 
			YARROW: Let us meet at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hourglass Observatory's</color>]]> warp tower on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin's</color>]]> equator when you are ready!
		CLARY: You have my gratitude, Yarrow. I look forward to visiting the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hourglass Observatory</color>]]> together with you!
