		OENO: The warp towers' rotating doors have been reported opening and closing on their own, without input from any Nomai.

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: After closer study, I can confidently conclude that the phenomenon is not caused by any structural defect in the doors, but by the sunless tide.
		</Text>

		<Text>
		OENO: As the Hourglass Twins orbit around each other, they become aligned along a straight line with the sun at regular intervals, with one twin closer to the sun.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: During this alignment, the twin farther from the sun feels not only the sun's great gravity, but also gravity from the twin closer to the sun pulling it in the same direction.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: These combined gravitational forces between the sun and another celestial body cause an extraordinarily strong pull of gravity towards the body closer to the sun.
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: The same force that causes sand to be funneled towards the other twin pulls the vision orbs upwards each time Ember Twin orbits overhead, causing the doors to activate.
		</Text>

		YARROW: My deepest gratitude for all your hard work, Oeno! I shall pass this scroll to our friends at the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> to share your findings with them.

		<Text>
		OENO: I was reminded of the phenomenon while studying this tower, as the alignment always causes a solar eclipse on the body farther from the sun.
