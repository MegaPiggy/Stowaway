		OENO: It is as I suspected, Poke. It appears the rotating doors' vision orbs rise every time the sand column passes overhead.

		<Text>
		POKE: But of course.. The sand column is currently flowing upwards towards <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin.</color>]]> It must be the sunless day that is pulling the doors' vision orbs in the same direction!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		POKE: We must investigate this further! Does that mean that the vision orbs would be pulled downwards when sand flows in the opposite direction?
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: I imagine that that would be much harder to notice.. There must be a better way to investigate our hypothesis.

		<ID>5</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
		POKE: In that case, I propose we wait for the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins'</color>]]> current sand transfer cycle to end!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<ID>6</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
		POKE: If the vision orbs no longer rise on their own in the sand column's absence, that would be a successful control to prove our hypothesis true!
