		<Text>
		OENO: The warp towers' rotating doors have been reported opening and closing on their own, without input from any Nomai.
		</Text>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: After closer study, I can confidently conclude that the phenomenon is not caused by any structural defect in the doors, but by the sunless day.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		OENO: As the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Hourglass Twins</color>]]> orbit around each other, they become aligned along a straight line with the sun at regular intervals, causing the sunless day on the twin farther from the sun.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: The twin farther from the sun feels not only the sun's great gravity - but also gravity from the twin closer to the sun, pulling it in the same direction.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: These combined gravitational forces cause an extraordinarily strong pull of gravity, pulling on the vision orbs as the alignment passes overhead and causing the doors to activate.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: The same force is also what causes sand to be pulled towards the other twin at the alignment point, creating the funnel of sand.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<Text>
		YARROW: My deepest thanks for your hard work in investigating this issue, Oeno! I am sure Bur will be relieved to hear your findings.
		</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>8</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: Normally, Ember Twin's gravity alone should not be enough to cause these vision orbs to activate. However, when combined with the gravity of the sun, the outcome changes.
