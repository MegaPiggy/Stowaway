		OENO: May I ask who has been leaving the rotating doors to this tower open? They must remain closed when not in use!

		<Text>
		OENO: By keeping these doors closed, we can ensure that any native life that is accidentally transported here does not wander far without protection or oxygen.

		<Text>
		OENO: An update: on closer inspection, the doors appear to be unlocking by themself.. This is very strange. Could there be some sort of defect in these rotating doors' mechanisms?

		YARROW: I have noticed these rotating doors opening and even closing by themself without input as well, Oeno! It is truly puzzling.

		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: The vision orbs that control the doors' mechanisms are controlled by sight.. I am unsure why these mechanisms are being activated in the absence of any input!

		YARROW: I recall the <![CDATA[<color=orange>solar towers</color>]]> on <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ash Twin's</color>]]> poles are controlled by similar mechanisms.. Perhaps we should travel to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>solar towers</color>]]> to investigate if the same thing occurs there, Oeno!
