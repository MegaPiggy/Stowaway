		AVENS: Daz, I am pleased to report that I was lucky enough to be paired to a memory statue today during a negative time interval!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>2</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>
		AVENS: Though it was exhilarating to see into the future, at the end of each interval, I saw my vision fading into a bright, fuzzy static.. Could I ask what causes that vision?
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<LocationA />
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<Text>
		DAZ: I am honored to have my brother-by-proxy's memories confided in my systems, Avens!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
		<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		DAZ: If this static vision occurred at the very end of each interval, there should be nothing to fear. You were simply witnessing the end of your conscious memory in the previous interval!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: Memories recorded by the memory statue are sent back in time to paired individuals at the end of each interval. This is known as the end-of-cycle transmission.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		DAZ: However, once this end-of-cycle transmission is complete, no memories beyond that point can be sent back - immediately ending the individual's conscious memory of the previous interval.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>7</ID>
		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		AVENS: I see.. In other words, we will not be able to recall what happens after the end-of-cycle transmission.. My thanks for this fascinating piece of information, Daz!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>8</ID>
		<ParentID>7</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		DAZ: I must insist you do not use the inability to recall memories beyond the end-of-interval transmission for mischief, Avens!
		</Text>
