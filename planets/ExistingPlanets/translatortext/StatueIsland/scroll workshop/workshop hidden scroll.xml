		CASSAVA: Daz, do you have the projection stone containing our conversation with the Deep Storm Station, from the day we became engaged? I wish to keep it as a memento of that day!

		<Text>
		DAZ: My love, I'm afraid you misunderstand! The conversation was not recorded on the projection stone itself, but the projection wall we wrote it on.
		</Text>

		<Text>
		DAZ: Conversations shared across projection walls are only recorded on the walls at both ends of the conversation, and viewed with the corresponding projection stones.

		<Text>
		DAZ: Put simply, one can only access that conversation through the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Lovers' Cove</color>]]> projection wall or the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Deep Storm Station</color>]]> projection wall, using the corresponding projection stones!

		<Text>
		DAZ: This applies for any conversation written on a projection wall! That is why a single projection stone can unlock many conversations across different projection walls.

		CASSAVA: I see.. Oh, how shameful to have only learned today how projection walls work when I am engaged to you, Daz!
