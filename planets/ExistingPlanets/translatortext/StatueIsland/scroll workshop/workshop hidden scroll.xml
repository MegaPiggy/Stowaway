		CASSAVA: Daz, I seem to be unable to retrieve a conversation I wrote using this projection stone. Could there be an issue with its data?

		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>

		<Text>
		DAZ: My love, I'm afraid you misunderstand! Conversations shared across projection stones are not recorded on the stone itself, like scrolls are - they are recorded on projection walls!
		</Text>

		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: The projection walls at both ends of the conversation record these shared conversations, and allow Nomai to view them again using the corresponding projection stones.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
		<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: To find the conversation you seek, you will need to use the corresponding projection stone at the projection wall it was written on!
		</Text>

		<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: This applies for any conversation shared across a projection wall! A single projection stone can unlock many conversations across different projection walls.
