	<TextBlock>
		<ID>1</ID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: Oeno, I have seen your scroll detailing the issues you encountered in your time using the voyager stones. (My thanks once again for helping to test this new technology!)
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock>
		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: To start: your first observation is indeed an intended feature! The memory storage systems allow one voyager (per mask) to remain on standby when disconnected, returning them to that exact position when reconnected.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock>
		<ID>3</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: This was done to facilitate a quick return to voyages far from the projection pool the voyage originally travels to!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: However: it appears this system currently fails to discriminate between the original host and any new users when a second Nomai voyages to the same destination, from the same projection pool.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		DAZ: As a result, any Nomai voyaging under these circumstances will be connected to any previous Nomai's outstanding voyagers, causing them to inherit its location.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: Furthermore, as the voyagers are advanced constructs connected to our memories, our very "essence"...
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

<TextBlock>
		<ID>7</ID>
		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: When connected to another Nomai's voyager in this way, the voyager may begin to transmit its experiences to both memory masks - causing the original host to receive the voyage in live visions!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	
<TextBlock>
		<ID>8</ID>
		<ParentID>7</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>		
			OENO: My thanks for your expertise, Daz! Your explanations seem to align with our experiences - Coleus was quite alarmed when he began to receive visions from my voyage!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>9</ID>
		<ParentID>8</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
			OENO: In this case: until these issues can be amended, we shall simply be mindful of disposing of our voyagers, so we may avoid sharing voyages with each other!
		</Text>
