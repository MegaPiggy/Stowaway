	<TextBlock>
		<ID>1</ID>

		<Text>
		DAZ: Oeno, I have seen your scroll and looked into the issues you encountered in your time using the voyager stones. (My thanks once again for helping to test this new technology!)
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock>
		<ID>2</ID>
		<ParentID>1</ParentID>

		<Text>
		DAZ: To start: your first observation connecting to a voyager outside the projection pool is.. somewhat of an intended feature!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

		<Text>
		DAZ: The memory storage systems allow one voyager (per mask) to remain on standby when disconnected, allowing for easy return to voyages far from the projection pool.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<ParentID>3</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: However, it appears the system cannot discriminate between the original host and any new users, causing anyone voyaging to the same projection pool to inhabit the voyager on standby.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>5</ID>
		<ParentID>4</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
		OENO: I see.. In other words, an outstanding voyager will cause anyone else using the same projection stone, from the same projection pool, to connect to that voyager and its location.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock>
		<ID>6</ID>
		<ParentID>2</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: However, regarding those strange thoughts you heard: the voyagers are advanced constructs connected to our memory masks, granting them access to our memories, our very "essence".
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

<TextBlock>
		<ID>7</ID>
		<ParentID>6</ParentID>
		<LocationB />
		<Text>
		DAZ: There is no issue when they are in sync with their host - but I suspect that while inhabited by a foreign consciousness, the voyager gains a certain level of self-awareness of their surroundings.
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	
<TextBlock>
		<ID>8</ID>
		<ParentID>7</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>		
			OENO: Goodness, Daz! Do you mean to say the voyager stones create.. semi-sentient clones of the users... And the panicked thoughts I heard were from the voyager I was inhabiting?!
		</Text>
	</TextBlock>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>9</ID>
		<ParentID>8</ParentID>
		<LocationA />
		<Text>
			OENO: I was pleased to learn that the solution to the first issue was to simply be mindful of disposing our voyagers.. But now, I feel quite uncomfortable at the idea of doing so!
		</Text>
