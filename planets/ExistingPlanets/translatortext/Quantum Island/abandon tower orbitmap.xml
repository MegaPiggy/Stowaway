		PLUME: Our dwelling has rapidly taken on a quantum nature following prolonged exposure to the quantum shard. As much as it pains me, I believe we must move our work to the planet's other islands.

		COLEUS: The island we arrived on our first expedition would be a good choice! The height of that island's cliffs offers the most protection from the ocean's waves.

		THATCH: Of note: this second island sails along the same direction as the planet's orbit around the sun - making its days about three times longer than one would experience on the other island.

		COLEUS: On the other apphendage, this would reduce the frequency of being immersed by the passing tides, which would be favorable for a site of construction!
