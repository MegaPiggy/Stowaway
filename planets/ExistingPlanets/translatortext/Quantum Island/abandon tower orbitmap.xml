		PLUME: The interior of the tower has rapidly become quantum after prolonged exposure to the quantum shard. As much as it pains me, I believe we must relocate to one of the planet's other islands.

		COLEUS: The island we arrived on our first expedition would be a good choice! The height of that island's cliffs offers the most protection from the ocean's waves.

		THATCH: Of note: this second island sails in the opposite direction as the other island, making its days about three times longer than one would experience on the other island.

		COLEUS: On the other apphendage, this should reduce how frequently the island is immersed, which would be favorable for a site of construction!
