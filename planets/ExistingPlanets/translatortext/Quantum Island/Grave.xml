		<Text>We shall depart for a final expedition of the bramble's exterior soon, where we shall search for survivors on shattered planet's north pole. But.. I do not have much hope.</Text>

		<Text>However small the odds, I had clung to the hope that our missing friends had managed to escape somehow and survived on one of these planets, even without a distress beacon..</Text>

		<Text>Where would our clan would be today, if we had never heard the signal from the Eye.. or taken more precautions before heeding its call?</Text>

		<Text>Our clan might have not lost so many, and its survivors might not have suffered such a long separation.</Text>

		<Text>I'm sleepy, papa.. Can we go back inside the tower and read a nocturnal story?</Text>
