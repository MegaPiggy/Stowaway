		PLUME: Our expedition team has explored as much of this planet as we are able. Yet we have failed to find any trace of our missing friends and siblings from the crash.
		PLUME: Both expedition teams to the forested planet, and to the exterior of Dark Bramble, have reported no signs of any survivors, either.
		PLUME: Without any current methods of precise propulsion, it would be foolish to even attempt an expedition of any sort into Dark Bramble's endless mazes..
		PLUME: However tiny the chance, I clung onto the hope that our missing friends had managed to escape and survive somewhere, somehow.
		PLUME: It seems.. I was simply mistaken in that hope.
		PLUME: I cannot help but imagine where our clan would be today if we had never heard the Eye's signal..
		PLUME: But was it the Eye that took from us, or was it the bramble?
		PLUME: Is it even fair to harbor ill will towards either? Our own foolishness and impatience inarguably contributed to the tragedy.
		PLUME: But even if we had taken the proper precautions, who knows how many more clans and lives might have fallen prey to the bramble as they tried to follow us, and any who followed them..
		PLUME: My mind grows tired, ruminating on these endless questions..
		PHLOX: Papa? Why are you sitting here alone?
		PHLOX: Are you watching the waves? Can I watch with you?
		PLUME: Of course, my little star. You are always welcome to join me.
		PLUME: Keek, wherever you are...
		PLUME: I promise to always care for your son like my own.
