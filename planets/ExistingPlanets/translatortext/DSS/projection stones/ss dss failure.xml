		YARROW: Is everyone ready? Using energy from Giant's Deep's electric core, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Deep Storm Station</color>]]> will soon power a 6-second negative time interval to test the mechanisms of the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Ash Twin Project!</color>]]>

		PYE: Our apologies for our tardiness, Yarrow! Idaea and I were lost on our way before Poke found us!

		IDAEA: Yarrow, a memory statue aboard the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> paired with me just now, and memories from a previous cycle were transmitted back to me. Does this mean that the project.. succeeded?

		YARROW: I am glad to hear from you at last, my friends. But.. It appears that the Eye of the Universe has eluded us once again.

		YARROW: Sadly, as predicted, a 6-second flight was nowhere near sufficient to cover the maximum possible distances of the Eye's orbit calculated by the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Southern Observatory.</color>]]>

		YARROW: The memory statues were only activated after the probe fired by the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Orbital Probe Cannon</color>]]> elapsed 20 billion loops, and began to repeat redundant flight trajectories.

		<Text>
		IDAEA: Though disappointing, this means the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Deep Storm Station</color>]]> still succeeded in its foremost priorities; we can now be certain that all mechanics of the negative time interval are theoretically sound and functional.

		PYE: Idaea is correct. Once the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> is complete, we can now be confident in its operation without fear of endangering the star system and ourselves. Have faith, Yarrow!
