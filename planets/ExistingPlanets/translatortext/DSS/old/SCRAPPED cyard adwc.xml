		CASSAVA: My gratitude for your hard work, Poke. After the test is complete, could we perhaps.. repurpose these warp cores for the warp tower connecting <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Giant's Deep</color>]]> to <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ash Twin?</color>]]>

		POKE: We could, as the warp cores are paired! But it would be a waste of warp cores engineered to handle far stronger energy... Oh, you were just nagging me about <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Giant's Deep's</color>]]> warp tower once more.
