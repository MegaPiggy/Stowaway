		OENO: You saw the vision orb move up slightly, didn't you, Coleus? Neither of us were looking directly at the orb, were we?

		OENO: I have been adjusting our vision orbs to accomodate the native lifeforms' vision to allow them to use them, you see. I am quite hopeful they'll learn to use it soon!

		COLEUS: I wish I could credit their eyes, Oeno - but I'm afraid it is more likely that may have been the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Attlerock's</color>]]> gravity tugging the vision orb upwards as it orbited overhead!

		<ParentID>5</ParentID>
		<Text>
		OENO: Was the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Attlerock</color>]]> orbiting overhead just now? Curses.. I can't seem to get them to look at the vision orb long enough without becoming distracted!

		CYCAD: Were you playing with the native lifeforms again, Oeno? You sure love teaching them more about our culture and technology!

		OENO: Of course! It's lovely seeing these lifeforms learn and grow more curious, now that they've grown much more comfortable with our presence.

		CYCAD: Oh, before I forget! Oeno: Yarrow was looking for you! There appears to be some issue regarding the warp towers on Ash Twin which he wanted you to look into.

		CYCAD: Apparently, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Sun Station</color>]]> crew reported to Yarrow that they noticed their warp tower's rotating doors opening and closing by themselves, without any sort of input.

		CYCAD: When Yarrow went to check on the issue, he noticed the same thing happening to the rotating doors at Timber Hearth's warp tower as well!

		OENO: How strange.. My thanks for delivering this message, Cycad. I shall travel to <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ash Twin</color>]]> to catch up with Yarrow and investigate this issue as soon as I can!
