      <Page>Crashes: 30 (All on purpose!)</Page>
      <Page>Alright! Looks like this chunk of Brittle Hollow is as stable as it gets.</Page>
      <Page>Like I'd have found that out if I'd just used the scout's integrity reading like Hornfels always nags about..</Page>
       <Page><![CDATA[<i>All</i>]]> the chunks read 100% integrity! It's how much that 100% decreases if you stomp too hard or whatever that matters!</Page>
      <Page>But uh.. Wow. Brittle Hollow... seriously lives up to that first part of its name.</Page>
      <Page>You're telling me just lightly bumping into a piece of its crust... with one of Slate's rickety ships... damages the crust <![CDATA[<i>that much?</i>]]> <![CDATA[<Pause=2>]]> ..That's just horrifying.</Page>
       <Page>I probably shouldn't keep trying to test surface integrity by crashing my ship into the planet then.. Repairs aside, might not be much of a planet left by the time I'm done.</Page>
         <Page>Anyway... What are these weird lil' crystals? They're making me stick to the wall.</Page>
          <Page>Guess they must play with gravity somehow? That's neat.</Page>
             <Page>I should try bring one home to Timber Hearth. Bet it'd make a pretty neat exhibit in Hornfels' new museum!</Page>
             <Page>If Slate could install one in the ship, maybe it'd help out with spacesickness in the ship, too.</Page>
             <Page>If it works, maybe I could finally fly that lil' hatchling who's afraid of space to see the ruins on this planet at last!</Page>
