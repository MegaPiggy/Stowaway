      <Page>Crashes: 30 (It's fun hearing the brittle crust crack)</Page>
      <Page>Woah. What are these weird lil' crystals? They're making me stick to the wall..</Page>
          <Page>Guess they must play with gravity somehow? Man, the Nomai had some sweet tech!</Page>
             <Page>I should try bring one home to Timber Hearth! Uh, if that's even.. possible.</Page>
              <Page>Bet it'd make a pretty neat exhibit in Hornfels' new museum.</Page>
             <Page>And if Slate could install one of these in the ship, it'd probably help out a ton with spacesickness in the ship, too.</Page>
