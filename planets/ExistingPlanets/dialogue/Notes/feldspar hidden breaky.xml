      <Page>Crashes: 30 (It's fun hearing the brittle crust crack)</Page>
      <Page>Woah. What are these weird lil' crystals? They're making me stick to the wall..</Page>
          <Page>Are they playing with gravity somehow? Oh, wow.. This would be incredible for exploring, wouldn't it?</Page>
             <Page>I <![CDATA[<i>gotta</i>]]> bring this home to Timber Hearth! If that's even.. possible.</Page>
             <Page>Hnnnng. HNNNNG.</Page>
              <Page>Okay, pulling isn't working. I think if I pull any harder I'm gonna break it..</Page>
               <Page>Guess you can't pull these out without breaking 'em once they're set? Good to know, I guess..</Page>
             <Page>Alright, note to self, Feldspar: if you find any more of these not stuck to a wall, bring 'em home!</Page>
             <Page>..Man, nothing in all these houses? Did the Nomai use them all up or something?</Page>
             <Page>Guess I'll keep looking elsewhere. I ain't going home without one to put on exhibit in Hornfel's new museum!</Page>
