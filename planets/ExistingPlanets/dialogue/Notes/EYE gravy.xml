      <Page>This crystal and others like it created a local gravity distortions used to traverse steep surfaces, when the planets still existed.</Page>
       <Page>A Nomai that survived aboard the Deep Storm Station constructed a superweapon composed of many of these crystals, inspired by the comet that had annihilated their clan.</Page>
       <Page>Powered by both curiosity and grief, they hoped to recreate the comet, and avenge their lost clan by delivering an even more destructive weapon towards the source of the Interloper.</Page>
      <Page>However, upon realizing the imminent danger of complete extinction that the Hearthians' ancestors faced, they were spurred to use their creation to protect them instead.</Page>
      <Page>Using the weapon's gravitational field, they collected as much ghost matter as they could with the weapon, before warping its payload into the Deep Storm Station - sacrificing themself to contain the matter safely.</Page>
      <Page>Thanks to their efforts, the Hearthians survived to explore a world largely safe of ghost matter shortly before the universe ended.</Page>
