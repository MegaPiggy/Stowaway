      <Page>Maaan. I'm all outta firewood now.</Page>
      <Page>Guess that's all the islands getting on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale this trip.</Page>
      <Page>But hey - looks like this second campfire's already faring much better than the first one I built down there!</Page>
      <Page>Should be safe up here from any more random waves washing up onto the shore and putting out my poor campfire, at least.</Page>
       <Page>That was a pretty horrible experience - closing my eyes around a warm campfire, and waking up cold and soaking wet..</Page>
      <Page>Well, colder and wetter than I already was.</Page>
       <Page>I should probably just count my lucky stars that I woke up before those waves carried me off the island with them..</Page>
       <Page>Stars above.. You sure know how to make sleeping hard, huh, Giant's Deep?</Page>
