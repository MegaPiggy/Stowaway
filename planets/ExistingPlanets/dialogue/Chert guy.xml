"My ship’s reactor went critical and I died in the resulting explosion."

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

		<Dialogue>
			<Page>Yeesh, that’s a gnarly dream to have right before a first launch.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll want to stay out of the Hourglass Twins’ sand stream, for sure. And watch out for rising sand levels whenever you’re inside a cave.</Page>
			<Page>Still, Chert hasn’t managed to get buried alive out there. And they’re <![CDATA[<i>]]>tiny<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>

"I just self-immolated on that campfire and you didn’t even notice."

			<Page>Feel free to keep your disturbing and violent dreams to yourself. I don’t feel like being traumatized today, thanks.</Page>
