				<Page>Goodness, have they been waiting all this time for the sand to start flowing between the Twins?</Page>

				<Page>We do! In fact, I was planning on announcing it to the village once I'd gathered more data about the phenomenon.</Page>
				<Page>We could even gather in the village regularly, to watch it happen with a little celebration!</Page>
				<Page>You see.. the Hourglass Twins' sand exchange occurs at very regular intervals.</Page>
				<Page>After spending an unhealthy amount of time on the Twins (goodness, you should see how tan I've gotten!) I have found that each time the Twins' sandflow subsides, it takes a consistent three weeks for the sand to flow back to the other twin.</Page>
				<Page>That the process takes place with such consistency only makes it even more puzzling to me, though.. I can't think of any natural phenomenon that occurs with such precision!</Page>

				<Page>Oh, how I wish I knew the answer to that question too, young hatchling.</Page>
				<Page>For sand to flow from one planet to the other.. then flow back to the other planet.. There is simply no rational explanation for it.</Page>
				<Page>The fact that the process takes place with such consistency only makes it even more puzzling to me. I cannot think of any natural phenomenon that occurs in this way, and with such precision!</Page>
				<Page>But still.. Until we find any evidence to the contrary, we can only conclude that it might be some natural phenomenon we do not fully comprehend yet.</Page>
				<Page>If you plan on exploring the Twins in search of an answer to this mystery, I do have another detail about the sand column, and some accompanying advice to share with you!</Page>
				<Page>For whatever reason, the column of sand that drains sand from one Twin to the other seems to only ever wander along the Hourglass Twins' equator.</Page>
				<Page>No matter how long I've stayed here, the sand column has never once wandered across this camp.</Page>
				<Page>To that end, I would suggest starting your exploration to the poles of the Hourglass Twins. That should keep you safe from being pulled into space by the sand column, or crushed by falling sand!</Page>

				<Page>It will take.. Ah, I'm.. not too sure, since I didn't keep track when this interval began..</Page>
				<Page>I am sure the interval does not last longer than 20 minutes, though. If you feel impatient, feel free to take a nap by a campfire to pass the time!</Page>
				<Page>Time slips by during a good nap, after all.</Page>
				<Page>I intentionally set up this camp to be out of the sand column's path - so please, rest easy about the possibility of the sand column wandering this way while you rest.</Page>

			<Page>How fascinating..</Page>
				<Page>So if I understand correctly.. Gravity from the sun and the twin closer to the sun cause a combined force that pulls sand to the other twin when the twins orbit into alignment?</Page>
				<Page>It sounds peculiar.. but it makes complete sense now that you've spelled it out!</Page>
				<Page>Surely, the gravitational centre of the solar system combining its pull with another planet would cause some interesting tidal effects. And you said the Nomai called this phenomenon the "sunless day"?</Page>
				<Page>Excellent work, hatchling. Solving a mystery that has puzzled me for ages on your first expedition is truly something else!</Page>
				<Page>After we gather more conclusive data on this phenomenon, we should mark your findings with a new exhibit in the village museum, then celebrate with some sap wine!</Page>
