				<Page>Ah, I’m guessing you heard about this from Mica?</Page>
				<Page>I hope you didn’t take too long to take off, or they’ll be telling future space cadets about how you delayed your launch for generations to come too, hah!</Page>
				<Page>As I've told them many times.. The reason I delayed my launch date was because sand on Ember Twin was flowing to and filling up Ash Twin at the time.</Page>
				<Page>Since I was hoping to explore Ash Twin on my first trip, the sand burying it would’ve made exploring anything rather hard!</Page>
				<Page>That’s why I opted to delay my launch - though more times than I'd have liked - until the sand began to flow back to Ember Twin.</Page>

				<Page>Indeed! I once spotted some tall Nomai structures on Ash Twin's surface we had never noticed before, while stargazing back on Timber Hearth. It seemed like a promising place to explore on my first trip!</Page>
				<Page>From what I could tell, the structures appeared to be for stargazing. Each one had windows in their roofs that allowed you to peer out and see the planets and stars.</Page>
				<Page>I must say, it was quite heartwarming to learn the Nomai shared my love for the stars!</Page>
				<Page>I looked around for a while - but at some point, I realized the sand column had sucked my ship with it back to Ember Twin!</Page>
				<Page>I had to cut my expedition short to make a distress call back to the village, and call Slate to pick me up. <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> ..I think he was more worried about my ship than me, though.</Page>
				<Page>Since sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin right now, why not check out Ash Twin for yourself, once a little more of its sand drains off?</Page>
				<Page>You should be able to glean much more about what these structures than I did, especially with that new translator tool of yours. Just be careful where you leave your ship!</Page>

				<Page>Why, yes! Haven’t you noticed before?</Page>
				<Page>Right now, sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin - but did you know the process eventually reverses? If you wait, you’ll see it eventually flows back to Ash Twin!</Page>
				<Page>We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.</Page>
				<Page>Even stranger, the process seems to happen in very precise intervals.. It's been consistent every time we've measured it. It's terribly fascinating!</Page>

				<Page>Hm... It will take a while longer, I believe.</Page>
				<Page>Come back once more of the sand has drained off from Ash Twin, and I might be able to give you a more precise answer then!</Page>
				<Page>If you’re feeling impatient, feel free to take a nap by the campfire to pass the time.</Page>
				<Page>I have set up this camp here to avoid the sand column's path - so you need not worry about the sand column wandering this way while you rest.</Page>

				<Page>Goodness! That's what those towers are?! How.. how could I have missed that?</Page>
				<Page>This does sound quite plausible.. The model ship and the Little Scouts do utilize some kind of Nomai warp technology that lets us warp them back to a fixed point, don't they?</Page>
				<Page>Oh, a Nomai warp system right under our noses... If I had been more observant, our space program might be revolutionized by now!</Page>
				<Page>But, you said that the Nomai used these "warp towers" to travel around their settlements across the star system easily, yes?</Page>
				<Page>There are Nomai ruins on Timber Hearth as well - so could there be a "warp tower" that connects to Timber Hearth as well?</Page>
				<Page>And if so, where would you arrive on Timber Hearth?</Page>

				<Page>Oh, hatchling! Imagine how much easier space travel would be for the space program, if this warp system connected us back to Timber Hearth!</Page>
				<Page>I would love nothing more than to go investigate for myself while the sand is flowing from Ash Twin.. but I must focus on finishing these star charts first!</Page>
				<Page>Would you kindly investigate in my stead? I shall catch up with you as soon as I finish my work here.</Page>

				<Page>Oh, what terrific news!</Page>
				<Page>..What's that? <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> There's GHOST MATTER on the arrival point?!</Page>
				<Page>(sigh) What terrific news... Oh, how frustrating..</Page>
				<Page>I suppose until we find a way around ghost matter - or, more likely, that patch of ghost matter evaporates with time - the space program will be stuck flying Slate's "spaceworthy" ships...</Page>
