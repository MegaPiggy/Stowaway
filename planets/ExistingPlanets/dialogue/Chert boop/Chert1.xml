				<Page>Ah, I’m guessing you heard about this from Mica?</Page>
				<Page>I hope you didn’t take too long to take off - or they’ll be telling future space cadets about how you delayed your launch for generations to come, too!</Page>
				<Page>As I've told them many times.. The reason I delayed my launch date was because sand on Ember Twin was flowing to Ash Twin on my launch date.</Page>
				<Page>Since I was planning to explore Ash Twin on my first trip, the sand burying it would’ve made exploring anything rather hard.</Page>
				<Page>That’s why I opted to delay my launch - though more times than I'd have liked - until the sand began to flow back to Ember Twin!</Page>

				<Page>Indeed! Have you seen the colossal towers of solar panels on each of the Ash Twin's poles? They are truly a magnificent sight to behold.</Page>
				<Page>I wished to visit Ash Twin to get a closer look at these wondrous structures. The Nomai must have been able to harness an incredible amount of energy with them!</Page>
				<Page>They look truly striking, set on each of the planet's poles.. Though it makes me wonder why they didn't build Ember Twin's solar panels on the poles as well.</Page>
				<Page>Fantastic view aside: you might be able to glean more about them with that new translator tool of yours! I highly recommend visiting them when you get the chance</Page>

				<Page>Why, yes! Haven’t you noticed before?</Page>
				<Page>Right now, sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin - but the process eventually reverses. In fact, if you wait, you should be able to see it beginning to flow back to Ash Twin!</Page>
				<Page>We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.</Page>
				<Page>Even stranger, the process seems to happen in very precise intervals.. It's been consistent every time we've measured it. It's terribly fascinating!</Page>

				<Page>Hm... It will take a while longer, I believe.</Page>
				<Page>Come back once more of the sand has drained off from Ash Twin, and I might be able to give you a more precise answer then!</Page>
				<Page>If you’re feeling impatient, feel free to take a nap by the campfire to pass the time.</Page>
				<Page>I have set up this camp here to avoid the sand column's path - so you need not worry about the sand column wandering this way while you rest.</Page>

			<Page>How fascinating..</Page>
				<Page>So if I understand correctly.. Gravity from the sun and the twin closer to the sun cause a combined force that pulls sand to the other twin when the twins orbit into alignment?</Page>
				<Page>It sounds peculiar.. but it makes complete sense now that you've spelled it out!</Page>
				<Page>Surely, the gravitational centre of the solar system combining its pull with another planet would cause some interesting tidal effects. And you said the Nomai called this phenomenon the "sunless day"?</Page>
				<Page>Incredible work, hatchling! Solving a mystery that has puzzled me for ages on your first expedition is truly something else.</Page>
				<Page>After we gather more conclusive data on this phenomenon, let us mark your findings with a new exhibit in the village museum, and celebrate with some sap wine!</Page>
