				<Page>Ah, I’m guessing you heard about this from Mica?</Page>
				<Page>I hope you didn’t take too long to take off - or they’ll be telling future space cadets about how you delayed your launch for generations to come, too!</Page>
				<Page>As I've told them many times.. The reason I delayed my launch date was because the Hourglass Twins' sand was flowing towards Ash Twin on the day I was setting off.</Page>
				<Page>Since I was planning to explore Ash Twin on my first trip, it'd have been silly to set off while it was being buried by oceans of sand.</Page>
				<Page>That’s why I opted to delay my launch - though more times than I'd have liked.. But surely I can't be blamed for the universe's whims!</Page>		
				<Page>Still, it certainly sparked a lifelong fascination with the Hourglass Twins in me. To this day, I can't help but wonder if there's more to the Hourglass Twins than natural phenomena.</Page>

				<Page>A good question! I once spotted a ring of tall Nomai structures along Ash Twin's equator while stargazing, and wished to visit Ash Twin to get a closer look at these structures.</Page>
				<Page>From what I could tell, the structures appeared to be for stargazing. Each one has windows in their roofs that allowed you to peer out and see the planets and stars.</Page>
				<Page>I must say, it was quite heartwarming to learn the Nomai shared my love for the stars!</Page>
				<Page>That's my interpretation, anyways! If you visit them, you might be able to glean more about them with that new translator tool of yours.</Page>

				<Page>Why, yes! Haven’t you noticed before?</Page>
				<Page>Right now, sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin - but the process eventually reverses.</Page>
				<Page>In fact, if you wait, you should be able to see it beginning to flow back to Ash Twin!</Page>
				<Page>Even stranger, the process seems to happen in very precise and consistent intervals.. Flowing from one twin to the other, and back again after the same length of time.</Page>
				<Page>It's a mystery that has bothered me for quite some time!</Page>
				<Page>But until we can find more evidence to the contrary, all we can conclude is that it seems to be a very strange natural phenomenon.</Page>

				<Page>Hm... It will take a while longer, I believe.</Page>
				<Page>Come back once more of the sand has drained off from Ash Twin, and I might be able to give you a more precise answer then!</Page>
				<Page>If you’re feeling impatient, feel free to take a nap by a campfire to pass the time.</Page>
				<Page>I set up this camp here to avoid the sand column's path - so please, rest easy about the sand column wandering this way while you rest.</Page>

			<Page>How fascinating..</Page>
				<Page>So if I understand correctly.. Gravity from the sun and the twin closer to the sun cause a combined force that pulls sand to the other twin when the twins orbit into alignment?</Page>
				<Page>It sounds peculiar.. but it makes complete sense now that you've spelled it out!</Page>
				<Page>Surely, the gravitational centre of the solar system combining its pull with another planet would cause some interesting tidal effects. And you said the Nomai called this phenomenon the "sunless day"?</Page>
				<Page>Excellent work, hatchling. Solving a mystery that has puzzled me for ages on your first expedition is truly something else!</Page>
				<Page>After we gather more conclusive data on this phenomenon, we should mark your findings with a new exhibit in the village museum, then celebrate with some sap wine!</Page>

				<Page>Goodness! That's what those towers are?! How.. how could I have missed that?</Page>
				<Page>This does sound quite plausible.. The model ship and the Little Scouts do utilize some kind of Nomai warp technology that lets us warp them back to a fixed point, don't they?</Page>
				<Page>Oh, a Nomai warp system right under our noses... If I had been more observant, our space program might be revolutionized by now!</Page>
				<Page>But, you said that the Nomai used these "warp towers" to travel around their settlements across the star system easily..</Page>
				<Page>In that case, could there be a "warp tower" that connects to Timber Hearth as well?</Page>
				<Page>Imagine how much easier space travel would be for the space program, if this Nomai warp system allowed us easy travel back to and from Timber Hearth!</Page>
				<Page>I would love nothing more than to go investigate for myself, while the sand is draining from Ash Twin.. but I must focus on finishing these star charts first!</Page>
				<Page>Would you kindly investigate in my stead? I promise to catch up with you as soon as I finish these charts!</Page>
