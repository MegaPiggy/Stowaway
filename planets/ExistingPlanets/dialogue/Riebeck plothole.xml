			<Page>I’m here to see the Hanging City. It’s always been my dream to see it with my own four eyes, ever since I was a hatchling.</Page>
			<Page>An alien race lived in this solar system long before our species even existed! How could I <![CDATA[<i>]]>not<![CDATA[</i>]]> want to see what their civilization was like?</Page>
			<Page>Only...</Page>
			<Page>You’ve... probably heard the others say it, right? I’m afraid of space. Seriously, I’m more surprised than anybody that I’m out here.</Page>
			<Page>Do you want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Tripped over a gravity crystal. It’s dumb luck I landed somewhere my Little Scout says is halfway stable, instead of being sucked into... <![CDATA[<i>]]>what’s below<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>I’ve been gauging the stability of the ground around me using my Little Scout, and this seems to be the place with the best surface integrity, so I’m just going to stay here until I’m ready to move on.</Page>
			<Page>...But that’s enough about me and my problems. You didn’t come all this way to listen to me blather, did you! Heh, that’d be... yeah.</Page>

			<Page>The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!</Page>
			<Page>Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a <![CDATA[<i>]]>you-know-what<![CDATA[</i>]]> is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>black hole<![CDATA[</size>]]> for something?</Page>

			<Page>How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!</Page>
			<Page>That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.</Page>

			<Page>A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!</Page>
			<Page>It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.</Page>
