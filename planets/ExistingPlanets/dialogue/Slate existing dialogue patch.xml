			<Page>Uhh, yeah? I thought it was pretty clear we were talking in dream terms.</Page>
			<Page>Pretty normal to get nightmares of all your phobias the day you take off.. Just ask Riebeck.</Page>
			<Page>Sheesh, I didn't know you were that paranoid about ghost matter you were dreaming about dying to it, though. Tektite really spooked ya, huh?</Page>
			<Page>Look, your suit should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all, so don't worry about just randomly falling into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, just use the scout to look out for it. You can even switch it to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>It's so convenient, it's honestly out of my hands if you still manage to walk into some ghost matter.. <![CDATA[<Pause=1>]]> Unless you'd like me to just magically make all ghost matter disappear to idiotproof the star system.</Page>
			<Page>Hm.</Page>
			<Page>That reminds me of something interesting I heard in the village the other day, actually..</Page>

			<Page>Hah! Sorry to get your hopes up, but it was probably just some nasty prank the kids were playing.</Page>
			<Page>If you really wanna know... I overheard one of the kids in the village say that ghost matter disappears sometimes.</Page>
			<Page>They were probably just trying to trick a more gullible hatchling into sticking a hand into some ghost matter.. <![CDATA[<Pause=1>]]> <![CDATA[<i>]]>Classic.<![CDATA[</i>]]></Page>	
			<Page>If you want, feel free to interrogate all those smallfries to figure out who it was and scold 'em for me. Don't want those kids losing a limb or two to something stupid now.</Page>

			<Page>Oh, ok. Just cut me off then.</Page>
			<Page>Bah, it's like you can sense when I'm about to sneakily ask you to do something.. On your way then, you rascal.</Page>

			<Page>Cool. Just remember, there's five suspects: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, you should try to be subtle with your questions, though.</Page>
			<Page>They might catch wind of your little investigation otherwise.. Trust me, they're smarter than they look.</Page>
			<Page>Try to ask real nonchalantly, like: "Did you hear anything about stuff that disappears sometimes?"</Page>
			<Page>Ah... I'd be a great detective.</Page>

			<Page>Stars above, just look around the village! They're all probably playing around somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
				<Page>Tephra and Galena should be playing in the village somewhere.</Page>
				<Page>I saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason, though - so don't take my word on that.</Page>
				<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village.</Page>
				<Page>Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
					<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
					<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
					<Page>Oh, and try to be subtle with your questions. Otherwise, the kids might catch wind of your little investigation.</Page>
						<Page>Try to ask them real nonchalantly, like: "Did you hear anything about stuff that disappears sometimes?"</Page>
						<Page>Ah, I'd be a great detective.</Page>
						<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably find all of 'em on the way up to the observatory for those launch codes, anyway.</Page>

"My ship’s reactor went critical and I died in the resulting explosion."

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

"I ran out of oxygen and suffocated."

		<Name>SuffocatedDeath</Name>

			<Page>Haha, that’s a classic!</Page>
			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>

"I got crushed to death on the Hourglass Twins."

		<Name>CrushedDeath</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>Yeesh, that’s a gnarly dream to have right before a first launch.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll want to stay out of the Hourglass Twins’ sand stream, for sure. And watch out for rising sand levels whenever you’re inside a cave.</Page>
			<Page>Still, Chert hasn’t managed to get buried alive out there. And they’re <![CDATA[<i>]]>tiny<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
