				Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?
			</Page><Page>
				So hey, don’t laugh, but I think I might have had some kind of spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face.

				One of the islands on Giant’s Deep has a Nomai statue on the beach - ever seen one? I brought one back to Timber Hearth with me. Big stone sculpture of a Nomai’s head, three eyes and everything. Beautifully carved, too.
			</Page><Page>
				So one minute I’m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing.
			</Page><Page>
				The sculpture replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again.

				It didn’t seem bad, just... weird? Were we the only ones who saw that happen?
			</Page><Page>
				I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them about it, but they told me I must have just nodded off out here and gotten confused.
			</Page><Page>
				Then we talked about dreams until Hornfels told me to go refill my oxygen tank before I talked myself to death.

Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.</Page><Page>As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.</Page><Page>You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included.

No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!</Page><Page>In case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body.

				I don’t think anyone on Timber Hearth is aware of the loop, ’cause I tried to ask ground control about it and everyone thought I’d gone crazy. And then later, they didn’t remember me asking in the first place.
			</Page>
			<Page>
				So I guess it’s just you and me who know, time-buddy. Maybe because we were the only ones who saw those statues while they were glowing?

				Kind of nice to not be alone, though. I’m glad you came by.
