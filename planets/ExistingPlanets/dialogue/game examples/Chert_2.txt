			<Page>Well, I was - that is, I originally came out here to update our star charts. Now, though, I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with the stars. There are so many - <![CDATA[<i>]]>too<![CDATA[</i>]]> many supernovae.</Page>
			<Page>Why are so many stars dying out? I’ve never seen anything like this.</Page>
			<Page>Frankly, I’m worried. And a little scared.</Page>

			<Page>To be honest, I haven’t left this lakebed. I don’t mean to brag, but I’m really quite good with the Little Scout, so I’ve been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite.</Page>
			<Page>Have you seen the old shipwreck site on Ember Twin’s southern hemisphere, the one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky? It’s not one of our own crashes, surprisingly enough - this one’s a Nomai ship.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I’d have seen it with my Little Scout.</Page>
			<Page>So where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground?</Page>

			<Page>On a scale of one to dead, I’d give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though.</Page>
			<Page>Right now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, if you’d like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won’t be disappointed.</Page>

			<Page>I have no idea! Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their life spans, so it's possible that the stars are older than we realized. Or maybe our models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected.</Page>
			<Page>Honestly, I'm not fond of either option! If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun...</Page>
			<Page>No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I- I'm probably overlooking something. That's it, I just need to collect more data.</Page>

			<Page>What? What makes you think that?</Page>
			<Page>It’s true the sun has... <![CDATA[<i>]]>changed<![CDATA[</i>]]>, lately, but I’ve not seen any evidence suggesting the approaching death of our sun! Stars above, no!</Page>
			<Page>I’ll tell you what, though - I’ll keep my eyes on the sun, and if I find any suggestion the its core is collapsing, you shall be the first to know.</Page>

			<Page>Did you! I hope they were useful?</Page>
			<Page>The planet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a much colder Giant’s Deep - it’s hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll notice, of course, that there’s no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy.</Page>
			<Page>That is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and began destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, and its shards were flung across space.</Page>
			<Page>Some of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed.</Page>

			<Page>How fascinating! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is entirely plausible, if you look at the physics of our solar system. It would just have to be incredibly far out there - farther than Hearthian ships would be able to travel.</Page>
			<Page>And honestly, we don’t know all that much about what’s all out there. The farther you go, the less we know! As such, it’s well within the realm of possibility such a planet exists.</Page>

			<Page>Oh yes, everyone loves a good mystery, don’t they? Who wouldn’t wonder about a moon that’s sometimes there and sometimes not!</Page>
			<Page>I’ve observed the Quantum Moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes, it quite simply disappears from the sky altogether. Maybe there’s another place it travels to!</Page>
			<Page>Unfortunately, if there is, I’ve never seen it. Perhaps if I take a closer look at these star charts...</Page>

			<Page>Is that what’s in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station?</Page>
			<Page>Quite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine!</Page>
			<Page>I wonder how were they able to travel back and forth from the Sun Station and the Hourglass Twins, when the slightest slip up would have meant a fiery death.</Page>

			<Page>You - what? I don’t... um. What?</Page>
			<Page>You mean to say there are modern Nomai out in other parts of space? And they believe the universe - all of it, the whole thing - is dying? <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]>Currently? <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]>...Right now?</Page>
			<Page>If... if that’s true, how could I have missed so many signs? The supernovae were there, but I, but, I’ve been studying the stars for... well, what does it matter if... oh...</Page>
