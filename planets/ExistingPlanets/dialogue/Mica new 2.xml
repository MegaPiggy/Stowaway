			<Page>Wha? Are you still half-awake from your nap, astronaut? You musta had some crazy dreams!</Page>
			<Page>Whatever. Let's hear your ideas for what causes the twins' weird shifting sands, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Pfff. I've heard that before too, astronaut!</Page>
			<Page>Slate says that's just Chert's fancy way of saying they don't know what causes it.</Page>
			<Page>I'd never say that to Chert's face.. but I feel like there's gotta just be more we haven't figured out there!</Page>

			<Page>Huh.. So it's gravity from the sun... and gravity from the twin closer to the sun combining, that causes sand to flow between the twins...</Page>
			<Page>Huh.. That makes sense! The sun's gotta have some strong gravitational pull, after all.</Page>
			<Page>If that's true, is that how Chert knows when the Hourglass Twins exchange sand so precisely? Well, that or they just measured how long it takes for the Twins to orbit into alignment.. That's probably more likely.</Page>
			<Page>I guess the only way we'll only know if your theory's true, is if the sand flows back to the other Twin the next time the Hourglass Twins align with the sun, huh?</Page>
			<Page>That's gonna take a while.. But I look forward to testing your theory out, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Stuff that disappears sometimes? Uh.. That's a really vague question, astronaut.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, Chert told me the sand column between the Hourglass Twins disappears sometimes! Does that count?</Page>

			<Page>Yeah! Didn't you know? That big column of sand only appears when sand flows between the Hourglass Twins. And that hasn't happened for a while!</Page>
			<Page>I remember Chert had just taken off into space again the last time sand flowed between the Twins.. And that's a while ago!</Page>
				<Page>Oh, but don't worry, astronaut! Chert said that sand should start flowing between the Twins again soon!</Page>
				<Page>Chert told me that on the morning of your launch day, as the sun rises over the village, the sand would start flowing between the Twins again at last.</Page>
				<Page>Isn't that lucky, astronaut? It feels like a good omen for your launch!</Page>
				<Page>I haven't the faintest clue how Chert knows when the sand exchange happens so precisely - but they've never been wrong before!</Page>
				<Page>Since you're taking off soon, you should visit the Hourglass Twins to see the sand column before it goes away again, astronaut. I bet it's an incredible sight up close!</Page>
