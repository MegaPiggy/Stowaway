			<Page>Yeah, haven't you noticed that column of sand's been gone for a while? Try looking at the Hourglass Twins with your signalscope right now, astronaut!</Page>
			<Page>Without sand flowing between them, the "Hourglass Twins" don't really live up to their name, do they? We should just call them "The Twins" the rest of the time, haha.</Page>
			<Page>Chert told me that sand would start flowing between the Hourglass Twins again on the morning of your launch day.</Page>
			<Page>I dunno how Chert knows when sand starts flowing again - but I'm just happy the Hourglass Twins are finally back!</Page>

			<Page>Aw.. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, when even Chert couldn't figure it out.</Page>

			<Page>Sounds like a plan.</Page>
			<Page>Hey, astronaut, if you learn anything about why sand flows between the Hourglass Twins, promise you'll come back and tell me all about it? I wanna learn more about this weird phenomenon too!</Page>

			<Page>Wha? Are you still half-awake from your nap, astronaut? You musta had some crazy dreams!</Page>
			<Page>Eh, whatever. Let's hear your ideas for what causes the twins' weird shifting sands, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Pfff. I've heard that before too, astronaut!</Page>
			<Page>Slate says that's just Chert's fancy way of saying they don't know what causes it.</Page>
			<Page>I'd never say that to Chert's face.. but I feel like there's gotta just be more we haven't figured out there!</Page>

			<Page>Huh.. So it's gravity from the sun... and gravity from the twin closer to the sun combining, that causes sand to flow between the twins...</Page>
			<Page>Huh.. That makes sense! The sun's gotta have some insane gravitational pull, after all.</Page>
			<Page>So.. If that's true, that means sand should stop flowing between the Twins once they orbit out of alignment, right? Haha, that sounds like a fun theory to test!</Page>
			<Page>It shouldn't take too long for the Hourglass Twins to orbit around each other again. Let's see if the sand stops flowing when they orbit out of alignment, astronaut!</Page>
