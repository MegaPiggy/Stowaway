			<Page>Wha? Are you still half-awake from your nap, astronaut? You musta had some crazy dreams!</Page>
			<Page>Eh, whatever. Let's hear your ideas for what causes the twins' weird shifting sands, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Pfff. I've heard that before too, astronaut!</Page>
			<Page>Slate says that's just Chert's fancy way of saying they don't know what causes it.</Page>
			<Page>I'd never say that to Chert's face.. but I feel like there's gotta just be more we haven't figured out there!</Page>

			<Page>Huh.. So it's gravity from the sun... and gravity from the twin closer to the sun combining, that causes sand to flow between the twins...</Page>
			<Page>Huh.. That makes sense! The sun's gotta have some insane gravitational pull, after all.</Page>
			<Page>But I can't just take what you tell me at face value! We gotta test it out!</Page>
			<Page>Umm.. I guess the only way we'll only know if your theory's true, is if sand stops flowing between the Twins once they orbit out of alignment, huh?</Page>
			<Page>That's gonna take a while.. But wow, I can't wait to test your theory out, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Questions about the universe? Uh, wow, you're putting me on the spot, astronaut! Uhh, lemme think a sec...</Page>
			<Page>How about.. No, I figured that one out... Um, what about... Oh, OH! I got one!</Page>
			<Page>Ahem... Why does sand stop flowing between the Hourglass Twins, astronaut?</Page>

			<Page>Yeah, haven't you noticed? Sand hasn't been flowing between the Hourglass Twins for some time now.</Page>
			<Page>When sand isn't flowing between them, the "Hourglass Twins" don't really live up to their name, do they? They should just be called "The Twins", haha!</Page>
				<Page>Oh well. At least we know the sand starts flowing between the Twins again real soon!</Page>
				<Page>Chert told me that when the sun rises over the horizon on the morning of your launch day, sand would start flowing between the Hourglass Twins again.</Page>
				<Page>Isn't that lucky, astronaut? It feels like a good omen for your launch!</Page>
				<Page>I dunno how Chert knows exactly when sand flows between the Hourglass Twins, but as long as it's coming back soon, I'm happy!</Page>

			<Page>Sounds like a plan!</Page>
			<Page>If you learn anything about the sand column, could ya come back and tell me all about it too?</Page>
			<Page>It probably wouldn't be useful knowledge to anyone... But it'd mean the world to me finally solve this weird little mystery!</Page>
