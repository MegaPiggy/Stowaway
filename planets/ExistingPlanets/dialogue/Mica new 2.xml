			<Page>You tell me! You astronauts always change your first launches at the last minute.</Page>
				<Page>Remember Gabbro's first launch? They delayed it just because they wanted to get another nap in first!</Page>
				<Page>And Riebeck, well, Riebeck had good reason to delay theirs, at least.. They had to be grounded while they calmed their nerves.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, oh - but remember <![CDATA[<i>Chert's</i>]]> first launch?</Page>
     		 <Page>They delayed their first launch <![CDATA[<Pause=1>]]> SEVERAL <![CDATA[<Pause=1>]]> times. We had like, three farewell parties!</Page>

		<Page>Beats me! I thought youâ€™d know, being in the space program and all.</Page>
		<Page>Actually, I'm pretty sure they explained why at some point, but everyone was too excited to see the takeoff at last to remember that part.</Page>
			<Page>Well hey, maybe if you <![CDATA[<i>take off soon...</i>]]> You can find Chert and ask them yourself about their launch day yourself!</Page>
