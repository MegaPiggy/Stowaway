			<Page>Really? You.. just woke up, though.</Page>
			<Page>Whatever. Let's hear your ideas for what causes the twins' weird shifting sands, astronaut!</Page>

						<Text>Chert says it's just some sort of natural phenomenon.</Text>
							<DialogueTarget>ModelRocketKid_Sand_No</DialogueTarget>

								<Text>It's caused by gravity from the sun and the twin closer to the sun combining during alignment.</Text>

			<Page>Pfff. I've heard that before too, astronaut!</Page>
			<Page>Slate says that's just Chert's fancy way of saying they don't know what causes it.</Page>
			<Page>I'd never say that to Chert's face.. but I feel like there's gotta just be more we haven't figured out there!</Page>

			<Page>Huh.. So it's gravity from the sun, and gravity from the twin closer to the sun combining, that causes sand to flow between the twins...</Page>
			<Page>Wait, so.. All I need to do is wait for the Hourglass Twins to align with the sun for the sand transfer to begin? How'd you figure that out in your sleep, astronaut?!</Page>
			<Page>I'm not sure about the science.. But it does kinda sound plausible! The sun's gotta have some strong gravitational pull, after all.</Page>
			<Page>Well, that's one lifelong mystery solved overnight. Thanks for telling me your brainwave, astronaut!</Page>

			<Page>Uugh, I'm gonna look so silly being angry about this..</Page>
				<Page>You should know this already, being in the space program and all - but apparently, the sand flows back and forth between the Hourglass Twins from time to time. It's wicked awesome!</Page>
				<Page>Thing is, it's been a pretty long time since the last time it's happened. Not like.. super long! But still a pretty long time.</Page>
				<Page>Since Chert told me about it, I've wanted to fly my new model rocket into that big ol' sand column that appears when sand flows between the twins.</Page>
				<Page>I asked Chert when the sand would start flowing between the twins again before they took off, and they told me it was gonna happen real soon!</Page>
				<Page>So I've been waiting and waiting, staring into the sun every single day trying to see if the sand's started flowing.. But it still hasn't happened!</Page>
     		 <Page>What's taking so long? When does this weird planetary sand exchange happen?! I'm going crazy waiting for it!</Page>
     		 <Page>Bah, I'm just ranting now.. Look, if you find Chert out in space, could you help me ask them why it takes so long for sand to flow between the twins, astronaut?</Page>

		<Page>Thanks, astronaut. Ugh, but I bet the moment you take off, the sand's gonna finally start flowing. I'm gonna have the biggest egg on my face..</Page>
		<Page>Dumb sand column.. It's so weird, not even Chert can make heads or tails of it!</Page>
		<Page>I wonder if we'll ever learn what even causes it.</Page>

		<Page>Yeah, yeah. That's what everyone tells me.</Page>
		<Page>I wait another day, then I beg Moraine to lend me their signalscope to check, and I get disappointed every time!</Page>
			<Page>Look, could you help me ask Chert if you see them? I just don't wanna put all my eggs in one basket.. No offense!</Page>
