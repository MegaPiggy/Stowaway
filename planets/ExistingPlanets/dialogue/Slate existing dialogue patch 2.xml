			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, just use the scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so just don't worry too much about the nebulous dangers of space, and take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Trying to solve some mysteries out there, are you? Sure, there's loads of things we don't know.</Page>
			<Page>You heard about the Nomai? That ancient species of aliens that once lived in our star system? You'd probably score a great exhibit in the museum if you could figure out what happened to them.</Page>
			<Page>And.. We still don't know where Feldspar went, or if they're even still alive.</Page>
			<Page>Every now and then, the village still asks if the space program's found any clues about Feldspar's fate.. Can't blame 'em, after the best pilot in the space program just up and vanished..</Page>
			<Page>Without some closure, you can't really move on, you know?</Page>

			<Page>Yeah, yeah, everybody has their theories what happened to them.. I'm done getting my hopes up.</Page>

			<Page>Ghost matter killed the Nomai? Pfft, I've heard way more fancy theories about the Nomai from Riebeck, hatchling.</Page>
			<Page>Well.. It doesn't sound impossible. Space <![CDATA[<i>]]>is<![CDATA[</i>]]> full of all kinds of dangerous things that could just wipe us out at any second.</Page>
			<Page>Still, it sounds a little sad and anticlimactic, doesn't it? These ancient, super advanced aliens, dying to something out of their control..</Page>

			<Page>Well, you better figure out what you wanna explore before you take off. Otherwise, it'll be a pretty boring and pointless waste of fuel going into space.</Page>

			<Page>Have you talked to a kid before? They're obnoxiously endless pools of curiosity. I'm sure one of them could give you some idea on what else to explore.</Page>
			<Page>..Besides, if you talk to them now, it'd help to get them off my back later because the newest astronaut didn't say bye to them.</Page>
			<Page>Just remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>

			<Page>Stars above, just look around the village! They're all probably playing around somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village somewhere?</Page>
			<Page>I saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see 'em on the way up to the observatory for the launch codes anyways.</Page>

			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>
