			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and for the record, you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, use your scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so stop worrying about the nebulous dangers of space and just take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Gabbro chunked a piece of the Nomai statue in the museum while hauling it back. Hornfels took a look at it, and said it was some kind of stone that could store information.</Page>
			<Page>It was just sitting around, so I thought it'd make a better component for data storage, than a museum exhibit.</Page>
			<Page>Didn't think to stress test it to make sure it wouldn't get busted by idiots, though...</Page>

			<Page>Uh, maybe?</Page>
			<Page>Oh, don't be dramatic. Not like there's anything on it worth worrying about losing, anyway.. You've hardly taken off the planet!</Page>
			<Page>Well, I dunno. Maybe you actually wrote down some spaceflight tips from Gossan. I guess we'll see how badly the data was hurt after I repair it.</Page>
			<Page>Here, hand over your ship keys for a bit - I'm not letting you take me on a joyride while I'm working on the ship.</Page>

			<Page>Sure did. It's working fine now.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, and good news: whatever was on there should be just fine. The computer busted because some corrupted data was trying to upload, but I terminated that data.</Page>
			<Page>Only odd thing is, I noticed a bunch of data already written in the ship log while fixing it up.</Page>
			<Page>Probably don't need to ask, but.. You didn't write all those logs, did you?</Page>

			<Page>Cool, cool.</Page>
			<Page>Just remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>

			<Page>Uh, I dunno? Pretty sure they're somewhere around the village.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village. Saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see all five squirts on the way up to the observatory.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, and don't forget to take the ship keys back from me later. Gonna be hard to take off without those.</Page>

			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
