			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, just use the scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so just don't worry too much about the nebulous dangers of space, and take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Trying to solve some mysteries out there, are you? Sure, there's loads of things we don't know.</Page>
			<Page>We don't know where Feldspar's gone, for one, or if they're even still alive. Ah, I miss my ship tester...</Page>
			<Page>Don't know what happened to the Nomai either. You'd probably score a great exhibit in the museum if you could figure out what happened to the ancient species that once lived in our star system.</Page>
			<Page>What else, what else... Oh, you seen that big Nomai station orbiting Giant's Deep? It's a pretty sight. Makes you wonder what it was built for, doesn't it?</Page>

			<Page>Have you talked to a kid before? They're obnoxiously endless pools of curiosity. I'm sure one of them could give you some idea on what else to explore.</Page>
			<Page>..Besides, if you talk to them now, it'd help to get them off my back later because the newest astronaut didn't say bye to them.</Page>
			<Page>Just remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>

			<Page>Stars above, just look around the village! They're all probably playing around somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village somewhere?</Page>
			<Page>I saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see 'em on the way up to the observatory for the launch codes anyways.</Page>
