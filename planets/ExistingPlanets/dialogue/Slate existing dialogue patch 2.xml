			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and for the record, you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, use your scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so stop worrying about the nebulous dangers of space and just take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Oh, right. I took your ship keys while you were napping.</Page>
			<Page>Hey, what's the big deal? Just making sure you talk to them before you take off.</Page>
			<Page>"Who?" The next generation of our space cadets, you dolt.</Page>
			<Page>The kids in the village are always bursting with questions for the new astronaut on launch day! Go take a round around the village and hear their questions out.</Page>
			<Page>It's just a good look for the space program, nurturing the next generation's love for space - but don't think about it like that. Think of it like.. A fun quiz about much you know about the star system!</Page>
			<Page>Oh, and uh, try to answer at least one of them, would you? So you don't look like we didn't teach you anything.</Page>
			<Page>Talk to me again once you've answered at least one of the hatchlings' questions, and I'll give you the keys back! You're free to take off after that.</Page>

			<Page>Alright! That was fun, wasn't it? You look like you've got some new drive to explore in your eyes too.</Page>
			<Page>Thank you for your service to the space program, blah blah blah. Here's your ship keys back.</Page>
			<Page>Now go on - take that ship and get outta here!</Page>

			<Page>Uh...huh. Might wanna work on your lying skills a bit. Get back to it, slacker.</Page>
			<Page>Come on, it can't be that hard to answer some kids' questions! Just one of them, any of them, and I'll give your ship keys.</Page>
			<Page>Trust me, I don't want to keep you grounded here and not flying the ship I put so much elbow grease into any longer than I have to.</Page>

			<Page>Cool, cool.</Page>
			<Page>Just remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>
			<Page>Come back and talk to me again when you've answered at least one of their questions, and I'll give ya back your ship keys to take off!</Page>

			<Page>Uh, I dunno? Pretty sure they're somewhere around the village.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village. Saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see all five squirts on the way up to the observatory for the launch codes anyways.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, and remember to come back and talk to me again when you've answered at least one of their questions! Can't take off without your ship keys otherwise.</Page>

			<Page>Hm? Oh, 'cuz I heard you talking in your sleep. Something you mumbled reminded me you hadn't done that yet.</Page>
			<Page>Did you know Feldspar was the one that started this tradition Feldspar? Fielding questions from the young'uns.</Page>
			<Page>Though, most of the questions you kids asked back then were like, "Are you really coming back" or "What will dying feel like".. Pfft, ye of little faith.</Page>
			<Page>But uh, wow. You sure talked a lot in your sleep last night. You do that normally?</Page>
			<Page>I'd get that checked out if I were you. You'd never live it down if the kids heard you mumbling in your sleep about "being stuck in a timeloop".</Page>

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>
