			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, just use the scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so just don't worry too much about the nebulous dangers of space, and take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Trying to solve some mysteries out there, are you? Sure, there's loads of things we don't know.</Page>
			<Page>We don't know where Feldspar's gone, for one.. <![CDATA[<Pause=1>]]> *sigh* I miss my most daring ship tester.</Page>
			<Page>Don't know what happened to the Nomai either. You'd probably score a great exhibit in the museum if you could figure out what happened to the ancient species that once lived in our star system.</Page>
			<Page>What else, what else... Oh, you seen that moon that disappears when you take your eyes off it? That's another weird one we haven't even begun to crack the mystery of.</Page>

			<Page>Really? <![CDATA[<i>None</i>]]> of t hose mysteries were enticing enough for ya?</Page>
			<Page>Sheesh, even Gabbro was curious which planet was best for napping on.. Guess you can't draw a magnet to lead.</Page>
			<Page>Well, you better figure out what you wanna explore before you take off, hatchling. Otherwise, it'll be a pretty boring and pointless waste of fuel going into space.</Page>
			<Page>..Oh, here's an idea!</Page>
			<Page>Try asking the kids around the village what questions they have about space! They might know some mysteries we've never heard of.</Page>

			<Page>Have you talked to a kid before? They're endless pools of curiosity.</Page>
			<Page>I'm sure they've got loads of dumb questions about the universe.. Maybe one of them might pique your interest on something new to explore.</Page>
			<Page>..Besides, if you talk to them now, it'd help to get them off my back later because the newest astronaut didn't say bye to them.</Page>
			<Page>Oh, and just so I don't get any complaints.. Remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>	
			<Page>Just hear out whatever dumb questions they might have about the universe! Even the dumbest questions deserve answers, after all.</Page>

			<Page>Stars above, just look around the village! They're all probably playing around somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village somewhere?</Page>
			<Page>I saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see 'em on the way up to the observatory for the launch codes anyways.</Page>

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

			<Page>Haha, that’s a classic!</Page>
			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>

"I got crushed to death on the Hourglass Twins."
	<DialogueNode>
		<Name>CrushedDeath</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>Yeesh, that’s a gnarly dream to have right before a first launch.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll want to stay out of the Hourglass Twins’ sand stream, for sure. And watch out for rising sand levels whenever you’re inside a cave.</Page>
			<Page>Still, Chert hasn’t managed to get buried alive out there. And they’re <![CDATA[<i>]]>tiny<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
