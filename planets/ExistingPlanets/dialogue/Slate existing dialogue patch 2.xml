			<Page>Stars above, your suit tells you when there's ghost matter anywhere nearby!</Page>
			<Page>Your suit has a built-in sensor that should alert you whenever there's ghost matter nearby at all - and for the record, you should be wearing that suit for oxygen at all times off-planet - so it's basically impossible to just run into a patch without warning.</Page>
			<Page>Once you know there's ghost matter around, use your scout to look out for it. You can even switch the scout to a handheld photo mode that lets you take pictures without launching it first.</Page>
			<Page>I'd honestly be impressed if anyone died to ghost matter with all these tools - so stop worrying about the nebulous dangers of space and just take off already.</Page>

			<Page>Oh, shoot. Yeah, there's one last one we forgot!</Page>
			<Page>You mind goin' round the village and asking all the little hatchlings if they got any questions about the universe?</Page>
			<Page>It's a tradition Feldspar started, just fielding some questions about what's out there from the lil' gills of the village.</Page>
			<Page>Doesn't matter what the questions are, just hear them out. It's just a bonus if you can answer them and make yourself look smarter.</Page>
			<Page>It's just a good look for the space program too, nurturing the next generation and all that stuff. One of those squirts might be curious enough about space to join the space program someday too, after all!</Page>

			<Page>Cool, cool.</Page>
			<Page>Just remember, there's five of those little squirts: Mica, Tephra, Galena, Arkose, and Moraine.</Page>
			<Page>Feel free to take off whenever once you've talked to all of 'em.</Page>

			<Page>Uh, I dunno? Pretty sure they're somewhere around the village.</Page>
			<Page>Mica's probably still fiddling with the model rocket, just up the hill.</Page>
			<Page>Tephra and Galena are probably playing in the village somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>I saw those two trekking outside the village recently for whatever reason though, so don't take my word on that.</Page>
			<Page>Arkose's probably still throwing rocks into the patch of ghost matter at the top of the village. Still uh.. no idea why they do that all day.</Page>
			<Page>And Moraine's probably stargazing on that big tree in the village, making sure Marl doesn't chop it down.</Page>
			<Page>I wonder if that Marl'll ever let go of that grudge.. No good comes outta holding a grudge against a tree, y'know?</Page>
			<Page>Just get a move on - you'll probably see all five squirts on the way up to the observatory for the launch codes anyways.</Page>

"My ship’s reactor went critical and I died in the resulting explosion."

			<Page>Ugh, I get that nightmare, too.</Page>
			<Page>Where you die, I mean. You’re not exactly a rocket scientist, you know? Me, I could fix a reactor gone critical in my sleep.</Page>
			<Page>If your ship reactor’s cooked, best thing <![CDATA[<i>]]>you<![CDATA[</i>]]> can do is to put as much distance as you can between you and the ship.</Page>

"I ran out of oxygen and suffocated."

		<Name>SuffocatedDeath</Name>

			<Page>Haha, that’s a classic!</Page>
			<Page>Don’t worry about it too much — I don’t know an Outer Wilds Ventures member who <![CDATA[<i>]]>hasn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> had that dream.</Page>
			<Page>But listen, as long as you keep an eye on your suit’s oxygen levels and remember to refill it inside your ship or wherever you find trees, you’ll be fine.</Page>
			<Page>Gossan’s still sore that the jetpack can run on oxygen once it’s out of fuel, but hey, it hasn’t killed anyone yet.</Page>

"I got crushed to death on the Hourglass Twins."

		<Name>CrushedDeath</Name>
		<Dialogue>
			<Page>Yeesh, that’s a gnarly dream to have right before a first launch.</Page>
			<Page>You’ll want to stay out of the Hourglass Twins’ sand stream, for sure. And watch out for rising sand levels whenever you’re inside a cave.</Page>
			<Page>Still, Chert hasn’t managed to get buried alive out there. And they’re <![CDATA[<i>]]>tiny<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
