			<Page>Yeah, I thought everyone knew that. Ghost matter evaporates slowly, doesn't it?</Page>
			<Page>Still, it's a little scary how long it's taken that little patch in the village to evaporate..</Page>
			<Page>The fact that there are Hearthian skeletons in there, tells us that little patch must have been around even when our Hearthian ancestors were learning to walk on land!</Page>

			<Page>Yeah! Didn't you know? Riebeck says those must have been early Hearthians, unlucky enough to stumble upon that patch of ghost matter while exploring the surface of Timber Hearth.</Page>
			<Page>Our species used to be aquatic before our ancestors learned to walk on land, you know.</Page>
			<Page>Riebeck thinks our ancestors learned how to live on land because if they didn't, we'd have died instantly whenever we got launched out of the water by geysers!</Page>
			<Page>But even though they could go on land, Riebeck says our ancestors mainly lived in the huge underground cave system inside the geysers.</Page>
			<Page>Apparently, there's a whole interconnected underwater cave system inside the planet that our ancestors swam around in!</Page>
			<Page>That part's a recent discovery, though. Nobody's even explored the waterways yet, since Riebeck "wasn't going to get eaten by an underwater monster", and the other astronauts were uh, busy, lazy, or missing.</Page>
				<Page>Oh, I can't even imagine what it'd be like... Swimming around those same waterways our ancestors lived in for millennia!</Page>
				<Page>I'd love to jump down a geyser and explore the waterways myself - but Mayor Rutile says I'll drown, since we can't breathe underwater like early Hearthians did, and I'm bad at holding my breath..</Page>
				<Page>Hey, um.. The traveler's spacesuit lets you breathe in space, right? Do you think it'd let you breathe underwater too, astronaut?</Page>
				<Page>I'd hate for you to get your spacesuit wet before your launch, but.. Could you jump down a geyser and explore the waterways inside Timber Hearth in my place?</Page>

				<Page>Really? You're the best, astronaut!</Page>
				<Page>If you do find anything down there, I wanna hear all about it, okay?</Page>
				<Page>Oooh, it's like revisiting the place where our ancestors came from! This is gonna be an incredible day for Hearthian history, astronaut!</Page>

				<Page>Woah.. What? A Nomai mural of.. our ancestors on land? That’s <![CDATA[<i>awesome!</i>]]></Page>
				<Page>It’s not a huge underwater monster like I was hoping.. But it’s still really awesome!</Page>
				<Page>But wait... <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> Doesn’t that mean Hearthians must have already existed when the Nomai were around?</Page>
					<Page>And it sounds like we were still able to live on both water AND land back then! </Page>
					<Page>Aw, when did Hearthians stop being able to breathe underwater completely then? If we were still able to breathe underwater nowadays, I'd be able to swim around the waterways all day..</Page>
				<Page>But wow.. Isn't this discovery gonna totally upend our knowledge of Hearthian history?</Page>
					<Page>I think you’d better fly to Brittle Hollow as soon as you can to tell Riebeck about this huge discovery, astronaut! They'll probably lose their marbles revising the Hearthian history books.</Page>
					<Page>Don’t forget, you can use your signalscope to track down the other travelers more easily!</Page>
