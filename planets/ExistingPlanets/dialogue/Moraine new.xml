			<Page>Oh, that.. Um, I just wanted to make a silly request if it's okay, astronaut.</Page>
			<Page>Do you remember that time Riebeck dropped their banjo into one of the geysers by accident? They were so worried and sad they had lost that banjo..</Page>
			<Page>Apparently, there wasn't any trace of the banjo after they grabbed their suit and jumped down after it. I was kind of spooked when I first heard this story..</Page>
			<Page>But days later, Riebeck found out the banjo had shot out one of the geyser mountains on the other side of the planet! Gneiss said it was a miracle.</Page>
				<Page>But ever since that incident, I've always been curious about what might be inside those geysers.</Page> <Page>There's gotta be some massive underwater cave system connected between the geysers for the banjo to have been carried so far from the village.</Page>
				<Page>Who knows how far they wind, or what we might find down there! I feel excited just thinking about it..</Page>
				<Page>I wanted to jump down there and swim around myself, but Mayor Rutile says I'll drown if I do that, so I should ask one of the astronauts to help me look instead.</Page>
					<Page>So... Um, could you maybe.. <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> jump in one of the geysers and look around if there's anything cool in Timber Hearth's spooky depths for me, astronaut?</Page>

				<Page>Really? You're the best, astronaut!</Page>
				<Page>If you do find anything, I wanna hear all about it!</Page>
				<Page>Just be careful not to hit your head right before your takeoff, okay?</Page>

				<Page>Woah.. What? A Nomai mural of.. our ancestors on land? ..That’s <![CDATA[<i>awesome!</i>]]></Page>
				<Page>It’s not some secret underwater monster like I was hoping.. But it’s still really awesome!</Page>
				<Page>But wait... <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> Doesn’t that mean Hearthians must have already existed when the Nomai were around?</Page>
					<Page>And it sounds like we were still able to live on both land and water back then! </Page>
				<Page>Man, when did Hearthians stop being able to breathe underwater completely then? If we were still able to breathe underwater nowadays, I'd be able to swim around the waterways all day!</Page>
				<Page>But wow.. Isn't this discovery gonna totally upend our knowledge of Hearthian history?</Page>
					<Page>I think you’d better fly to Brittle Hollow as soon as you can to tell Riebeck about this huge discovery, astronaut!</Page>
					<Page>They're probably going to lose their marbles revising the Hearthian history books.</Page>
					<Page>Don’t forget, you can use your signalscope to track down the other travelers more easily!</Page>
